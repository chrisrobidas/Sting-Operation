# Sting-Operation

FPS where our character miniaturizes himself to take revenge on the wasps that stung him, developed in 72h during the Ludum Dare 56 game jam.

This game was made using Unreal Engine 5.4
Note: There is not really a commit history because the game was originally made using a Perforce server, then later moved to Github.
